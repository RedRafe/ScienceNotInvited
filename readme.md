# SCIENCE NOT INVITED
Choose what science packs are needed to research technologies! Tired of all types of science? Want to megabase but not want to deal with all packs? Now it's possible! 

### Main features
This mod lets you choose what science packs will be needed in order to research technologies. By default all vanilla science packs are included, but you can choose to opt out any of them (except red science which is required in order to progress in the tech tree). Beware: the tech tree will not be modified and you'll still need to research other science packs in order to progress. You may even craft other science packs, but if the're disabled in the mod settings they will not be consumed in the laboratories as they wont be needed. The mod also scales the resource needed to progress in game. That means, if you have disable some science packs, the raw material you'd invest in that packs will be re-distributed among the remaining ones.
